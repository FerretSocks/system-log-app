I forgot to meditate this morning, but spent most of the day getting Gemini to make me an app. It made me late on getting work done, but i found it help me find a purpose and inspiration through the creativity of it. The app is a task tracker with a journal integrated. This was actually written in that journal. I've just got home and have kept working on it. Its so much fun. Might play some games now, but ive found this creation process has cheered me up greatly.
